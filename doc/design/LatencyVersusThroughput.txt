Latency versus thoughput
========================
Author: Bela Ban
Date:   Feb 2023


JGroups can be configured to reduce latency (e.g. for synchronous RPCs), or to provide high throughput (e.g. for
asynchronous sending of messages).

Unfortunately, there is no middle ground configuration which provides both low latency *and* high throughput.

This document therefore lists the changes that have to be made to a configuration to either provide low latency or
high throughput. There will be 2 sample configurations as a result of this work.



Components to look at
---------------------

* Single sender / multiple senders

* Bundler type (TransferQueue, NoBundler, PerDestinationBundler)

* Thread pool enabled/disabled

* JDK: virtual threads available?

* OOB or regular messages (FIFO delivery per sender needed)?
  * DONT_BUNDLE flag set?

* Transport: TCP, TCP_NIO2 or UDP?

* TCP: output/input stream buffering? (TCP.buffered_{output,input}_stream_size)
